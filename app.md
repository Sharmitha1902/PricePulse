### Documentation for Stock Forecasting Web Application

### Overview
This Stock Forecasting Web Application, constructed using Streamlit and advanced machine learning techniques, empowers users to visualize stock market data and project future price movements leveraging a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

#### Key Components

1. **Dependencies**:
   - **Streamlit**: Facilitates the creation of a user-friendly web interface for interactive data analysis.
   - **Pandas**: Serves as a robust library for data manipulation and comprehensive analysis.
   - **YFinance**: A specialized library designed to procure stock data from Yahoo Finance.
   - **Plotly**: Utilized for crafting interactive visualizations that enhance user engagement.
   - **Datetime**: A module for effective handling and manipulation of date inputs.

2. **LSTM Prediction Function**:
   - Imported from an external module (`model.py`), this function encapsulates the logic required for training the LSTM model and generating stock price forecasts.

3. **Application Configuration**:
   - The application is configured with the title "Stock Forecasting App" and incorporates a tailored layout to optimize the user experience.

4. **User Inputs**:
   - **Stock Code**: A text input field enabling users to specify the stock ticker (e.g., 'AAPL').
   - **Start Date**: A date input for users to select the commencement of the data retrieval period.
   - **End Date**: A date input allowing users to designate the conclusion of the data retrieval period, defaulting to the current date.
   - **Forecast Days**: A slider permitting users to choose the number of days for which future price predictions will be made (ranging from 1 to 30 days).

5. **Session State Management**:
   - Leverages Streamlitâ€™s session state to preserve the fetched stock data, ensuring continuity across user interactions.

6. **Data Fetching**:
   - Upon clicking the "Fetch Data" button, the application retrieves historical stock data for the specified stock code and date range utilizing the `yfinance` library.
   - In the event that no data is located, an error message prompts users to try an alternative stock code.
   - Successfully fetched data is presented in a tabular format, accompanied by a line chart depicting the closing prices over time.

7. **Data Visualization**:
   - The application employs Plotly to generate dynamic and interactive graphs illustrating historical stock prices.
   - Closing prices are plotted against the corresponding dates, providing users with a lucid visual representation of stock performance.

8. **Stock Price Forecasting**:
   - The "Forecast Stock Price" button initiates the LSTM prediction process.
   - Provided that valid stock data is available, the LSTM prediction function yields future price forecasts predicated on historical data.
   - These predicted prices are juxtaposed with historical prices in a dedicated line chart, enabling users to discern contrasts between past performance and future projections.

9. **Error Handling**:
   - The application incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to address instances where no stock data is available or when users attempt to forecast prices without prior data retrieval.

#### User Experience
- The application is meticulously designed to be intuitive and user-centric, offering a streamlined interface for data input and results visualization.
- Its responsive design ensures compatibility across a diverse array of devices, thereby enhancing accessibility for a broader audience.

This documentation delineates the architecture and functionality of the Stock Forecasting Web Application, elucidating how it aids users in making informed stock market decisions through data visualization and predictive analytics powered by machine learning.
