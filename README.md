 Stock Prediction Web Application Documentation

## Project Structure
The project is organized in a modular structure to facilitate ease of maintenance and scalability. The main components include:
- **app.py**: The main entry point of the Streamlit application, handling user inputs, data fetching, and displaying results.
- **model.py**: Contains the `lstm_prediction` function, which implements the LSTM model for stock price prediction.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all necessary dependencies required to run the application.
- **data/**: (Optional) A directory for storing any sample datasets or assets used in the project.
- **assets/**: (Optional) Contains any images, logos, or additional resources for the web application.

## Features
- **User Input Interface**: Users can input stock codes, specify date ranges, and select the number of days for forecasting via a user-friendly sidebar.
- **Data Visualization**: Historical stock prices are visualized using interactive charts created with Plotly, allowing users to analyze trends and movements effectively.
- **LSTM-Based Forecasting**: The application employs an LSTM model to predict future stock prices based on historical data, providing insights into potential market trends.
- **Dynamic Forecasting**: Users can adjust the forecast period, and the application will generate updated predictions and visualizations accordingly.

## Usage
To run the Stock Prediction Web Application:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using the command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start the Streamlit application by running:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
6. Use the sidebar to enter the desired stock code, date range, and forecast days, then click "Fetch Data" to load the stock data. After fetching, click "Forecast Stock Price" to view the predictions.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `yfinance`: To fetch historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
- `streamlit`: To create the web application interface.
- `plotly`: For interactive data visualization.
- `tensorflow`: To build and train the LSTM model.
- `scikit-learn`: For data preprocessing utilities.

Ensure all dependencies are installed by running the command in the **Usage** section.

## Future Enhancements
- **User Authentication**: Implement user login and registration functionality to save user preferences and forecasting history.
- **Model Optimization**: Experiment with different hyperparameters and architectures to improve the accuracy of the LSTM model.
- **Additional Features**: Include technical indicators and other data sources for enhanced prediction capabilities.
- **Historical Comparison**: Allow users to compare predicted prices against actual historical data for better analysis.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimize the UI for mobile devices to enhance accessibility and usability.

## Conclusion
The Stock Prediction Web Application leverages machine learning techniques to provide users with valuable insights into stock market trends through historical data analysis and future price predictions. By combining user-friendly design with powerful data visualization and forecasting capabilities, the application serves as an effective tool for stock market investors. With potential future enhancements, this project can evolve into a more robust platform for financial analysis and decision-making.
